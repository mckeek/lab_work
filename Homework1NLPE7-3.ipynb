The First Order rose from the dark side... you did not. You may try, but you cannot deny the truth that is your family. Well, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time. We've got company. You have to hide. Come on, BB-8! Hurry! I see 'em! You take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me? (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates) I'll come back for you! It will be alright. So who talks first? You talk first? It's just very hard to understand you with all the... ... Apparatus. All right. All right! Not really. Might wanna rethink your technique. The Resistance will not be intimidated by you. If -- what--? You with the Resistance--?! I can fly anything. Why, why are you helping me? (it hits him) You need a pilot. We're gonna do this. I am calm. I always wanted to fly one of these things. Can ya shoot? Okay, same principal! Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons, and mag pulse -- use the site on the right to aim, triggers to fire! I can fix this. STAR DESTROYER TECHNICIAN We have an unsanctioned departure from bay two. FIRST ORDER COLONEL Alert General Hux and stop that fighter. I got it! Woooahhh! This thing really moves. All right, we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far! I'm gonna get us in position, just stay sharp! Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it? I've got us dead centered. It's a clean shot. I saw it! Hey, what's your name? FN-whaa? Well I ain't using it! FN, huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right? I'm Poe. Poe Dameron. Good to meet you too, Finn! One's coming towards you. My right, your left. Do you see it? Nice shot. We're going back to Jakku. That's where. I got to get to my droid before the First Order does! That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind. This one is, pal. That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker! Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you! JESS (V.O.) Copy that! SNAP (V.O.) We're with you, Poe! WOOHOO! So are you! What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing-- BB-8 says that you saved him. You completed my mission, Finn. That's my jacket? No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn. General Organa. Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base. The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report. I wish that were the case, Major. This was the Death Star. This is Starkiller Base. We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got. So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go!

This is Starkiller Base. Stay here. Look how old you've become. You know what I've come for. The map to Skywalker. We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order. I'll show you the dark side. You're so right. The old man gave it to you. Search him. Put him on board. Kill them all. I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Comfortable? I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map. Where is it? Where... is it? It's in a droid. A BB unit. I leave that to you. ... The one from the village. FN- 2187. How capable are your soldiers, General? They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army. Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed. I want that map. For your sake, I suggest you get it. The droid... stole a freighter? Anything else? What girl? Yes. He means nothing to me. By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced. Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it.

You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? (Rey stares at him) You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea. Tell me about the droid. He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You.

She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. Supreme Leader. I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance. NO! She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. Put every hangar on lock-down. She's going to try to steal a ship to-- KYLO REN (CONT'D) Han Solo... Find them. Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. What do you think you'll see if I do? Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him. No. The Supreme Leader is wise. It's too late. I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me? Thank you. We're not done yet. It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you. TRAITOR! KYLO REN (CONT'D) That lightsaber. It belongs to me! You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force! I know where you come from.

That was pretty good. They're big and dangerous... FINN (O.S.) It was the Republic. KYLO REN (CONT'D) You still want to kill me. GENERAL HUX (O.S.) Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. GENERAL HUX (CONT'D) That the girl was all we needed. As a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already.

That's the only name they ever gave me! What you've brought me today is worth... Hmmm... One quarter portion. These five pieces are worth... Let me see here... One half portion. What about the droid? I'll pay for him. Sixty portions. Follow the girl and get that droid. HEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!! Quiet, girl! Tal'ama parqual! Parqual zatana! NOMA. Shhhh. That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts.

This droid says you stole it! Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master. So you're with the Resistance? I've never met a Resistance fighter before. BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base. Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. What is it? (re: her hand) What are you doing?! Let go of me! (pulls her hand back) I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! They're shooting at both of us! Well, thanks for that! Are you okay? Stop taking my hand! Hey! Yeah.

The Ileenium system? I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry! I gotta get back to Jakku! No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! Yes! None of your business, THAT'S WHY! -- No it can't be -- FINN FOLLOWS REY TO: Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden. Get off. Get off! See anything? What do we do-- there must be -- Yeah, but I fixed that -- C'mon BB-8. Oooh... You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers? I'm hurrying! ...I'm the pilot... No, it's true: we're the only ones on board. Niima Outpost. Who had it, Ducain? I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain. This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo? No, the smuggler! This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...! Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on Wait! No -- we need your help! This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible! What's a Rathtar? No. What about BB-8? What are you gonna do? Can you see them? They have blasters... Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs! Resetting the fuses should do it. Oh no. Wrong fuses. Huge! What do they look like? Are you sure? FINN! FINN!!!! Finn! That was lucky! Han! Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere. And you could use a co-pilot. From inside the hangar? Is that even possible? Compressor. I can fix that! Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank-- I by-passed the compressor. The First Order wants the map. (re: Finn and BB-8) Finn is with the Resistance... Go ahead. Why'd he leave? The Jedi were real? ... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy... I think I can handle myself. Yeah, you pull the trigger. Rey. Are you offering me a job? You're offering me a job. If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. I've already been away too long. Clean? What fight? Finn! What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base. What are you doing? You can't just go. I won't let you. Finn, what are you talking about? Don't go. What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there. I have to get back to Jakku. Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could. Luke. I'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this. What are you doing? BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you. Safety! You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely through her fear) I hope so, too. Where am I? Where are the others? That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask.

(points to horizon) Niima Outpost is that way, stay off Kelvin Ridge. I don't speak that. Alright, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay? (BB-8 backs up) -- I'm just trying to get away from the First Order -- but you tell us where your base is, I'll get there first -- deal?! (BB-8 COCKS his head) Droid, please. Yes, I must get my proper arm reinstalled. I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly, he may never be his old self again. You're welcome. You have to go back. (he BEEPS again) Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it. Use the ventral cannons. Yes, and he had help. Fire. No prior signs of non-conformity? Destroyed? They were going back for the droid -- send a squad to the wreckage. Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must. I won't have you question my methods. My men are exceptionally trained -- programmed from birth-- Careful, Ren. That your \"personal interests\" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke. Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th-- The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Yes, Supreme Leader. Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this... as the last day of the Republic! FIRE! We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system. Begin charging the weapon! Report. FIRST ORDER OFFICER Weapon charged in fifteen minutes, sir. Dispatch all squadrons... Prepare to fire. The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun. Last week they were a half portion each. Sixty portions. Come on. Are you okay? Go ahead. Nothing, sir. Nothing here. Go ahead! Ren wants the prisoner. Turn here. Listen carefully: you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here. Call in the air strike! FN-417, hold position! Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl. Traitor! Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody! We have incoming at two-eight-point- six! Move! Dispatch! Move! Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble all squads! Anti-air cover en route to our position! Request air support! Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops. Pull back the tree line! Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. We're searching the area. Hey! If -- what--? No no no! I'm breaking you out. Can you fly a TIE fighter? Not yet. Okay, go. This way. 'Crazy thing is, it's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true. I've already been away too long. \"Finn.\" Yeah, \"Finn\", I like that! I like that! Good to meet you, Poe! Hold on! I see it! Where are you going? No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! What - a droid?! I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important! We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die! Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I-- Poe! Poe! Poe!!! POE! POE!!! POE!!! Water... water... water.. -- Awgh, GAH! What--?! Thief? OW! HEY! What?! I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! (BB-8 has ZAPPED him It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed. Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah. Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different. Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. Come on! Come on, BB-8! No, we gotta move! Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked! I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?! -- Are you okay? We can't outrun them! We need a pilot! You?! (then, indicates one Y'ever fly this thing? Great. (reacts to seat) Whoa! I can do this, I can do this-- Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low! Stay low! It confuses their tracking! I'm working on it! Are the shields up? Try sitting in this thing! We need cover, quick! Damn it! Come on... come on... I'm getting pretty good at this! The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em! Okay! For what? ARE WE REALLY DOING THIS?! Whooo! I don't know your name. Finn. What's yours. Rey... Whoa! What's going on? How bad is it?! They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! (Throws a tool) This? You gotta tell us where the base is. (searching, to BB-8) Go on BB-8, tell her. Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. (searching for tape) What about you? (loses his mind) BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! ! This? Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? ... That can't be good. ... Oh no. It's the First Order. You said poisonous gas -- Can you unfix it? I got it. I'm okay. BB-8 get off me... Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins. Hurry! You can understand that thing? Thank you! Junkyard! Han Solo? The Rebellion General? Wasn't he a war hero?! He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him. Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey! You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you? Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?! Good. THREE?! How'd you get them on board? What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them? No. A lot of 'em. Close the blast doors from here? Oh no, what? This was a mistake! They look like that. This way! REY! It had me! But the door--! You take care of Chewie! No problem! Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie! Hurt him?! He almost killed me six times! (Chewie GRABS HIM by the collar, ROARS) Which is fine. You're welcome. Do you know what happened to him? Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here -- Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers? Solo, why are we here again? We can trust her, right? Please, we came here for your help. There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right-- What's this? What are you doing? Solo, what is she doing? (eyes on Maz) You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen. You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run. Come with me. I can't. I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. (to Big Head) Don't leave without me. I'm not who you think I am. I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper. Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me. Take care of yourself. Please. The First Order, they've done it. Where's Rey? Take it! Find your friend! I need a weapon. Thanks! Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot! NO!! REY!!! No, no, no, no... REY!! He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone! Poe. Poe Dameron. You're alive! What happened to you? No, no, no. It wasn't just me. Oh here. Poe -- I need your help. (surprised she knows) Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner-- That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast. It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. There is one. Precinct 47. Here. Kid, you worked there, what do you got? (beat, then:) I can do it. I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet-- Now you tell me? How are we getting in? We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way. Sanitation. I don't. I'm just here to get Rey. Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force! Come on! I have an idea about that. Remember me? Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge. Follow me. You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields. Do it. Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey. I disagree. What do we do with her? Yeah, there is... We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover. Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- (improvising, fast) -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to Why are you doing that? Why are you doing -- this? I'm trying to come up with a plan. What happened -- did he hurt you? We came back for you. What'd he say? How did you get away? Solo. The Falcon's this way. Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no... Come get it. Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers-- Yes, sir. Bringing them online -- KYLO REN (O.S.) General Hux. Is it the Resistance pilot? Sir. Ventral cannons hot. Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D) It escaped capture aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter. Not exactly, sir. It had help. LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D) We have no confirmation, but we believe FN-2187 may have been helped in the escape-- The two were accompanied by a girl. From one of our own. GENERAL HUX (CONT'D) We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was. General. They've been hit. Disabled. They were headed back to Jakku -- the fighter's projected to crash in the Goazon badlands. Disabled. They were headed back to Jakku -- the fighter's projected to crash in the Goazon badlands. Poe!!! POE! POE!!! POE!!! -- Awgh, GAH! OW! HEY! What?! He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed. You gotta tell us where the base is. Hurry! You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him. This way! What's this? What are you doing? Solo, what is she doing? You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run. Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me. The First Order, they've done it. Where's Rey? No, no, no, no... REY!! You're alive! Precinct 47. Here. Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey. What'd he say? I won't have you question my methods. My men are exceptionally trained -- programmed from birth-- STOP IT! Poe didn't make it. (sees BB-8 is sad, Look, I tried to help him. I'm sorry... I'm with the Resistance. Are you okay? Go ahead. What about that ship? Y'ever fly this thing? I hope. I don't know your name. You take care of Chewie! Take it! Find your friend! Kid, you worked there, what do you got? Please! ... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy... -- No it can't be -- FINN FOLLOWS REY TO: Chewie, we're home. Where are the others? Where's the pilot? You? And \"that thing\" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta there. Where'd you get this ship? Jakku?! That junkyard? Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches! Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good. I used to be. Twelve! Fourteen. Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line! -- Stress on the hyperdrive-- (who is she? Then:) Chewie, throw 'em in a pod, we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet. My help? Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten I'm hauling Rathtars. Oh great. It's the Guavian Death Gang -- they must've tracked us from Nantoon. I got three of 'em going to King Prana. I used to have a bigger crew. Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon. He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way. There's one. Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it. Bala-Tik. What's the problem? You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other? Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money. I never made a deal with Kanjiklub! Tasu Leech. Good to see you. Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before? What was the second time? First I've heard of it. ... I got a bad feeling about this... I got the door. Cover us! Chewie! You okay? (looks at bowcaster) Wow. Come on! Come on! You, close the door behind us! Hey, where are you going? I hate that guy. I got one, he's back there. Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed -- I never ask that question until after I've done it. This is not how I thought this day was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there! Come on baby, don't let me down! What?! Electrical overload! The coolant's leaking! -- Secondary tank, I got it! You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me! This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems. What'd you do? Move, Ball. Nah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest. Good job, kid. And thanks. So, fugitives, huh? Let's see whatcha got. This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him. He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible... He walked away from everything. There're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple. I used to wonder that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light. No, you rest. (To Rey and Finn) You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop. D'you just call me \"Solo\"? Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Always. You might need this. I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. You know how to use one of these? There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name? Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon. I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much. I'm thinking about it. Well? Jakku? Chewie, check out the ship as best you can. It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you. To get your droid on a clean ship. Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet. Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare... REY AND FINN At what? Any of it. (Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving) Hey, Maz! Chewie's working on the Falcon. Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia. Leia doesn't want to see me. I don't know, but it ain't good. Keep it, kid. Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could. Where'd you get that? Come on, Chewie! Hey, can I try that? I like this thing. You okay, Big deal? It's the Resistance. Quick! Yeah, yeah, I know... You changed your hair. No, new jacket. ... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here. Leia... Do what? She heads off. I'm trying to be helpful! C-3PO (O.S.) BB-8. You're wasting your time. C-3PO (CONT'D) It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data. Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him. There was nothing we could've done. (hard for him to say) There was too much Vader in him. We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever good at. We lost our son, forever. If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I? So it's big. Okay, how do we blow it up? (all eyes on him) There's always a way to do that. We disable the shields. I like this guy. We'll get you there. If I told you, you wouldn't like it. Chewie, check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives. That's what I did it. So you'd miss me. It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good. Some things never change. Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. Alright, Chewie, get ready. And Now! I AM PULLING UP!!! I get any higher, they'll see us! What was your job when you were based here? Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields? People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--! That's not how the Force works--! Oh really, you're cold? The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields? Bring it down. Bring it down. Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her. Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor? You sure you're up for this? Are you all right? Good. Escape now. Hug later. They're in trouble. We can't leave. (to Finn, re: Chewie) My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em. KAYDEL KO CONNIX General, are you seeing this? That girl knows her stuff. We'll set the charges at every other column. You're right. That's a better idea. (checks his detonator) You take the top. Ben! Take off that mask. You don't need it. The face of my son. That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive. Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you. Yes. Anything. Where are the others? Where's the pilot? Where'd you get this ship? Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line! Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten Oh great. It's the Guavian Death Gang -- they must've tracked us from Nantoon. Chewie! You okay? (looks at bowcaster) Wow. Come on! Come on! This is not how I thought this day was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there! What?! What'd you do? Good job, kid. And thanks. No, you rest. (To Rey and Finn) You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop. Always. You know how to use one of these? Well? It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you. I like this thing. ... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here. And Now! Oh really, you're cold? You're right. That's a better idea. (checks his detonator) You take the top. Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches! Chewie, check out the ship as best you can. Who had it, Ducain? Wasn't he a war hero?! -- Stress on the hyperdrive-- (who is she? Then:) Chewie, throw 'em in a pod, we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet. Yes, I do. Every time. Han Solo. You are a dead man. The problem is we loaned you fifty thousand for this job. I heard you also borrowed fifty thousand from Kanjiklub. The question is how much longer will we know each other? Not long. We want our money back now. Kanjiklub wants their investment back, too. Tell that to Kanjiklub. Yeah. Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle. That BB unit... the First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives. Kill them! And take the droid! Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they want. And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon. SNOKE (V.O.) The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance... Wrong again, Solo. It's over for you. Twice! Nowhere left for you to hide. Search the freighter. Wrong fuses. From inside the hangar? Is that even possible? No problem! ... Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise. General! Our strategy must now change. Go. Oversee preparations. There's been an awakening. Have you felt it? There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo. Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test. We shall see. We shall see. And the droid? Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker. Good. Then we will crush them once and for all. Prepare the weapon. If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me. Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren. By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced. ... I'm just a scavenger. ... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy... I've already been away too long. Han Solo! Where's my boyfriend? I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it. A map to Skywalker himself? You're right back in the mess. Hmm. No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home! The only fight: against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us. If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run. You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear. Who's the girl? That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him and now, it calls to you! Han told me. (reaches out, hold The belonging you seek is not behind you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it. The light. It's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it. I've had this for ages... Kept it locked away. A good question for another time. Those beasts! They're here! Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now go. You have one! Alert the Resistance. Their missing droid is here! Inform the First Order... I've found the droid. Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing... But my first battle, I made a choice. I wasn't going to kill for them. So I ran. NO! No, come back! Quiet, girl! Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could. The light. It's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it. Those beasts! They're here! Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl. I like this thing. We have incoming at two-eight-point- six! Move! Dispatch! Move! Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble all squads! Anti-air cover en route to our position! Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops. Yeah, yeah, I know... Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See- Threepio! (sees Han, stops) You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. (sees Leia, General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke. Princesses. Oh my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed. Thank the Maker! And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes! It would take a miracle to save us now. R2-D2! You've come back! You found what? How dare you call me that! Oh! The map! It is complete! (to R2-D2) Oh my dear friend. How I've missed you. Look who it is! Did you see who? Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General. Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly. Same jacket. (takes Finn's hand) And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life -- Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry. We're desperate for anything you can tell us. And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know. DR. KALONIA I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home. Don't do that. Anything. Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO. When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star. You think I want to forget him? I want him back! That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both. We both did. No. He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You. Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. There's still light in him. I know it. (eyes on datacard) The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now. (then, heart sinking) Our system is the next target. Han's right. Han, how? No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. I did miss you. ... Pretty good. True. You still drive me crazy. If you see our son again, bring him home. Han did it! Send them in! Tell me. (hand on her heart) -- Luke -- Rey. May the Force be with you. (takes Finn's hand) And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life -- That sounds very scary. You must be so brave. C-3PO (O.S.) BB-8. You're wasting your time. C-3PO (CONT'D) It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data. It was Snoke. You're my guest. He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You. If you see our son again, bring him home. May the Force be with you. General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming. You're my guest. What did you say? I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum! I will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. And I'll drop my weapon. Yes, sir. Weapon charging. Weapon at full capacity in thirty seconds. They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself. We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale. Approaching target. I got one behind me. See it? Watch out for ground fire! Yes! A laser cannon? It's another Death Star. How is it possible to power a weapon of this size? They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate. The Oscillator's still standing. The Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional. OFFICER TABALA ZO Admiral, their weapon will fire in two minutes. (at first hesitant) In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator... If we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon. Give Poe full authorization to attack. If we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon. It's another Death Star. ... Maybe the planet. True. You still drive me crazy. Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert. General, their shields are down! X-wings coming back for another round of attacks! Hey! Black Leader, go to sub-lights. On your call. Dropping out of lightspeed. Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. Looks like our friends got in! Yes, General. Lieutenant, get back to your station! But no damage! Roger! I'm hit! Why are you doing that? Why are you doing -- this? I'm trying to come up with a plan. Yeah, I'm on it! Furillo's been hit! We're overwhelmed! What do we do? It isn't working! Watch out! Two more X-wings down. That's half our fleet destroyed. I'll go down below. Detonator. We'll meet back here. Solo. No, no. We just lost R-1! Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck, Poe! (stops, fleetingly) Just look. We won't survive -- even Hux has gone! GENERAL HUX (V.O.) Supreme Leader. It is time to complete his training. Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a heartbeat. C-3PO (CONT'D) (he swats R2-D2, who Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We must go tell the others at once! C-3PO (O.S.) General? Excuse me, General? C-3PO (CONT'D) R2-D2 may contain some much needed good news.\n"
