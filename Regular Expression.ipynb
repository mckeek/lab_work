Here are some of those special characters and character sequences:\n",

If you experiment with the grep command a bit and read the documentation for grep, you will find some subtle differences between the regular expression support in Python and the regular expression support in grep. As an example, grep does not support the non-blank character \"\\S\" so you will need to use the slightly more complex set notation \"[^ ]\", which simply means match a character that is anything other than a space.\n",
